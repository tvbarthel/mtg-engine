/**
 * Creatures represent warriors, minions, beasts and monsters that serve the player, usually by fighting on his or her
 * behalf. Because almost all creatures can attack each turn to reduce an opponent's life, or block the opponent's
 * attackers, creature cards are fundamental to most deck strategies.
